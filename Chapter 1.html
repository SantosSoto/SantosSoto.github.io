        </h1>
        <p>
            An equation is a math statement that shows the relationship between two expressions.
        </p>
        <h4>left side = right side</h4>
        <hr>
        <h4> for example: 5x = 2x + 5</h4>
        <p>
            In this case the equation has 5x on the left and 2x + 5 on the right. 
            usually we want to solve for x. in this case in order to solve for x we need
            to move all "x" terms to one side and all constants(numbers without an x) to the 
            the other side. to move anything from one side to the other we need to change 
            the sign of the term we are moving, in this case to move 2x to the left
            we have to subtract 2x from both sides.
        </p>
        <h4>3x = 5</h4>
        <p>
            Now that we have all the x terms on one side and all constants on the other side
            we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3.
        </p>
        <h4>x = 5/3</h4>
        <p>
            Now that we found x, here are some other rules to remember when solving equations:
            <ul>
                <li>The equation that we had at the beginning can also be solved a different way
                    <br>5x = 2x + 5
                    <br> -5 = 2x - 5x
                    <br>-5 = -3x dividing both negative sides creates a positive!
                    <br>x = 5/3
                </li>
                <li>if you are solving for x you should always try to keep constants on one side while the variable on the other</li>
                <li>Lastly remember to always combine like terms since the beginning, constants with constants and variables with variables</li>
