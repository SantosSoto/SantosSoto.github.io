# SantosSoto.github.io

Hi I finally uploaded the website. I have to add a couple caviats before you start!

1. the accounts.js has the accounts that can access the site, for your convinience the username is "santos" and password is "111"
2. I could not implement the AI chatbot that I was thinking about because I have been pretty busy at work, i really wanted to use one of the very simple models for the hell of it but it is what it is.
3. I choose the color pallet to make it more appealing to a younger audience which is what I hoped for
4. lastly the video player is the same on every page, I was thinking about making a small video for each one but I did too many pages, I did not knew the videoplayer would work since on visual studio code it did not work for some reason(I think it was because of browser shinanigans!). So at the end I just used an old video i had from a class TOTALLY unrelated to the project and mainly to see if it would work.

thanks!
